Information that is already easy to understand by simply reading the code. For example, in File E it says: “The full array size is 2 * capacity - 1.” That is already clear from the code just a few lines below. For me, it is important to find a good balance between helpful documentation and writing too much unnecessary text. Finally, each function should briefly explain what it does, and the code should contain short comments above key calculations, clear but not excessive."
