File B stood out as the most complete and precise – it explained the exponent-based board representation, the rotation-to-left trick, and reward calculation very clearly, with proper arguments and return values documented for each method. It even noted that str only prints instead of returning a string, which shows good attention to detail. File E was also very strong, cleanly written and comprehensive, but it had small inconsistencies such as reward type (float vs int) and the states dtype not matching the actual integer board. File C was good overall, but less polished because of a major inaccuracy in the str docstring and a few type mismatches. File D was accurate but less refined, with some typos and shorter explanations, and it leaned on external links rather than being fully self-contained. Finally, File A was the weakest – it was still an improvement over having no documentation, but it was less precise, had inconsistencies (like str saying it returns a string when it doesn’t), and didn’t go into the same level of detail as the others. The main factors I used were correctness of the documentation (especially around terminal state handling and type descriptions), readability and clarity of the explanations, completeness in covering all functions and helpers, and whether the documentation stayed relevant to the code without going off-topic."
